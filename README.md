- **Sales Extraction:** Utilized the INDEX MATCH function to extract specific data fields (Bright Code, Name, Brand, Supercat, Cat, Subcat) from the first and second sheets.
  
- **Sales Aggregation:** Applied the SUMIFS function to aggregate sales from the Raw Data sheet, allowing for a comprehensive overview of overall sales.

### 2. Product Details

- **Product Overview:** Examined the product details sheet to gain insights into the characteristics of each product, including SKU, monthly sales, and values.

- **Dynamic Data Retrieval:** Leveraged the INDEX MATCH function to dynamically retrieve relevant information based on SKU, ensuring accurate and up-to-date insights.

### 3. Monthly Sales and Value Analysis

- **Monthly Performance:** Analyzed the monthly sales and values of the top 1-10 SKUs, providing a granular view of product performance over time.

### 4. Brand Performance Summary

- **Brand Sales:** Applied the SUMIFS function to find the sales of each product based on the channel, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of brand performance.

- **Monthly Trends:** Utilized subtotal functions to find the total sales for each month and calculated month-on-month changes, offering insights into the trends over time.

- **Conditional Formatting:** Implemented conditional formatting to visually represent trends, making it easier to identify upward, downward, or stable patterns in sales.
